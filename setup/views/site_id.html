<h1 class="page-header">Optional Site ID Selection</h1>

<p>Most OpenEMR installations support only one site. If that is
true for you then ignore the rest of this text and just click Continue.</p>
<p>Otherwise please enter a unique Site ID here.</p>

<p>A Site ID is a short identifier with no spaces or special characters other
than periods or dashes. It is case-sensitive and we suggest sticking to lower
case letters for ease of use.</p>

<p>If each site will have its own host/domain name, then use that name as the
Site ID (e.g. www.example.com).</p>

<p>The site ID is used to identify which site you will log in to. If it is a
hostname then it is taken from the hostname in the URL. Otherwise you must
append <code>?site=siteid</code> to the URL used for logging in.</p>

<p>It is OK for one of the sites to have <code>default</code> as its ID. This is the ID
that will be used if it cannot otherwise be determined.</p>
