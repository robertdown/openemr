<p>Congratulations! OpenEMR is now installed.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Access controls (php-GACL) are installed for fine-grained security, and can be administered in
        OpenEMR's admin->acl menu.
    </li>
    <li>Reviewing {{oe_site_dir}}/config.php is a good idea. This file
        contains some settings that you may want to change.
    </li>
    <li>There's much information and many extra tools bundled within the OpenEMR installation directory.
        Please refer to openemr/Documentation. Many forms and other useful scripts can be found at openemr/contrib.
    </li>
    <li>To ensure a consistent look and feel through out the application using
        <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/'>Firefox</a> is recommended.
    </li>
    <li>The OpenEMR project home page, documentation, and forums can be found at <a href="http://www.open-emr.org"
                                                                                    target="_blank">http://www.open-emr.org</a>
    </li>
    <li>We pursue grants to help fund the future development of OpenEMR. To apply for these grants, we need to
        estimate how many times this program is installed and how many practices are evaluating or using this
        software. It would be awesome if you would email us at <a href="mailto:president@oemr.org">president@oemr.org</a>
        if you have installed this software. The more details about your plans with this software, the better, but
        even just sending us an email stating you just installed it is very helpful.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We recommend you print these instructions for future reference.
</p>
<?php if (empty($installer->clone_database)) {
    echo "<p><b>The initial OpenEMR user is '" . $installer->iuser . "' and the password is '" . $installer->iuserpass . "'</b></p>";
    echo "<p>If you edited the PHP or Apache configuration files during this installation process, then we recommend you restart your Apache server before following below OpenEMR link.</p>";
} ?>
